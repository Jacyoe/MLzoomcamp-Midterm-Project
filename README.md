## Predict Student Performance

Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/students-performance

For this project, I used the dataset to predict the students' end-of-term performance

The first 1-10 columns of the data contains personal questions,such as: Student age, sex, transportation type, e.t.c

The next columns 11-16 are family related questions and the rest of the column are questions on education habits such as: flip education, attendance, e.t.c
